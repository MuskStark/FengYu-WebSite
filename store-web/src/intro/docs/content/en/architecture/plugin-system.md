description: Infinia 4.0.0 plugins are self-contained .fyp packages — a manifest, a UI micro-frontend, and an out-of-process JSON-RPC 2.0 worker.jar — mounted in a sandboxed iframe and supervised by the host's PluginProcessManager.

# Plugin System

An Infinia plugin is a self-contained **`.fyp` package** that adds both UI and backend capability without touching the host process. The defining design rule is **isolation**: a plugin's code never runs inside the host Spring context, and its UI never shares the host's DOM tree.

## The `.fyp` package

A `.fyp` file is a zip archive with three parts:

| Path | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `manifest.json` | Plugin metadata, permissions, and the AI tools it exposes |
| `ui/` | The micro-frontend assets, served by the host under `/plugin-runtime/{id}/**` |
| `backend/worker.jar` | The worker executable, spawned as its own process |

For the manifest field reference, see [Manifest](/en/plugins/manifest).

## Out-of-process workers

The worker is the plugin's backend. It speaks **JSON-RPC 2.0** over stdio and is spawned as a **separate operating-system process** — it never lives in the host Spring context. The host invokes it through `POST /api/plugin-runtime/{id}/invoke` with a `{method, params}` body; the host's `PluginProcessManager`:

- spawns and **owns** the worker process for the plugin's lifetime,
- dispatches each JSON-RPC call to that process,
- resolves any `ref_*` FileRefs in the parameters to absolute filesystem paths before dispatch, so the worker receives real paths it can open directly.

Because workers are out-of-process, a worker crash or hang cannot take down the host, and a worker cannot reach into host beans or the JPA session.

## Process isolation backends

Workers and AI-authored commands are wrapped by `ProcessSandbox`, which selects a native isolator per
platform. The `GET /api/security/process-isolation` endpoint reports the active backend and surfaces
`compatibilityMode: true` when no isolator is available.

| Platform | Backend | Process-tree termination | Filesystem isolation | Network isolation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Platform | Backend | Process-tree termination | Filesystem isolation | Network isolation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Linux | `bubblewrap` (`bwrap --die-with-parent --new-session`) | kernel | **full** — minimal read-only view (OS/runtime trees + JDK + the plugin's own package + its classpath roots — **not** `$HOME`); writes confined to plugin-owned roots | isolated unless declared |
| macOS | `sandbox-exec` (Seatbelt profile) | tree-kill | **reduced / advisory** — deny-sensitive (allow-default, then deny reads of host credentials `~/.ssh` `~/.aws` `~/.config/gcloud` `~/.gnupg` etc. and the whole FengYu runtime root; writes confined to plugin-owned roots + `/tmp`). A plugin can still read non-allowlisted user files, so this is NOT reported as full isolation. | isolated unless declared |
| Windows | `windows-job` (Win32 Job Object, `KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE`) | **reliable** — the Job kills the whole tree on handle close or `TerminateJobObject` | **not enforced** (known gap) | **not enforced** (known gap) |
| Other / no isolator | `none` | host shutdown hook + tree-kill backstop | none — explicit approval only | none — explicit approval only |

> **Honest reporting.** Only Linux reports `sandboxed: true` (full isolation). macOS reports
> `sandboxed: false, reduced: true` — its profile is deny-sensitive rather than a strict
> `deny-default` (a JVM cannot launch under `deny-default` on macOS; it reads/writes under
> `~/Library` for caches/preferences), so a plugin can still read non-allowlisted user files. The
> host does NOT claim macOS is fully sandboxed; the chat approval gate treats it as reduced. Linux
> bwrap uses a minimal read-only view that excludes the user home, so `~/.fengyu` and user secrets
> are invisible to the plugin there. A true minimal allowlist on macOS (deny-default + an explicit
> JDK/runtime read set) is a tracked follow-up that would flip macOS to full isolation.

On Windows the Job Object backend is a **process-layer** isolation only: it guarantees the worker and
any descendants (e.g. a `pip` subprocess) terminate reliably when the host closes the job handle, which
removes the long-standing gap where `ProcessHandle.descendants()` could miss orphans on Windows. It
does **not** confine filesystem writes or block network the way `bwrap` and `sandbox-exec` do on Linux
and macOS — that gap is intentional and documented; the explicit-approval gate still guards every
effect on Windows.

Because a Job Object is **not** a security sandbox, the host reports Windows honestly as
`compatibilityMode: true` / `sandboxed: false` (with `lifecycleIsolation: job-object`) and the chat
approval gate treats Windows like any other no-security-sandbox platform — it does not relax approval
just because a backend is active. The `unsandboxedPlugins` Settings toggle is therefore shown on
Windows (it is in compatibility mode); ON = workers run bare with app-equivalent privileges, OFF =
Job-Object lifecycle isolation only (no filesystem/network boundary). Real OS filesystem/network
isolation on Windows (AppContainer / restricted token + ACL + network capability) is a tracked
follow-up.

## Sandboxed UI

The plugin's `ui/` micro-frontend is served by the host as static assets under a strict Content Security Policy at `/plugin-runtime/{id}/**` — these asset paths are the only plugin URLs that bypass the token filter, so the UI can bootstrap without a credential. The [micro-frontend host](/en/architecture/frontend) loads the entry page in a sandboxed iframe; no plugin code is imported into the host JavaScript realm.

Inside the iframe, the SDK `@infinia/plugin-sdk` provides a `FengYuClient` that bridges to the host over `postMessage`. The plugin uses this client to call its own worker (which the host forwards as JSON-RPC) and to request file access — it never talks to the OS directly.

## Installed plugin descriptor

The host exposes installed plugins through `InstalledPluginDescriptor`. Its fields are:

| Field | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| `id` | Unique plugin id |
| `name` | Display name |
| `description` | Short description |
| `category` | Category id (see the category tree) |
| `icon` | Icon identifier |
| `version` | Plugin version string |
| `uiEntry` | Resolved UI entry URL |
| `author` | Author string |
| `permissions` | Declared permissions (e.g. `files.read`, `files.write`) |
| `enabled` | Whether the plugin is currently enabled |
| `iconStyle` | Hardcoded `"BLUE"` |
| `supportsAi` | `true` when `aiTools` is non-empty |
| `source` | `OFFICIAL` or `THIRD_PARTY` |

`GET /api/plugin-runtime` returns the array of enabled descriptors; the SPA's `plugins` store consumes them.
