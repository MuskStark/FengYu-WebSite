## From goal to workflow

**Infinia** (蜂语 / FengYu) is an *AI-native orchestration platform*. You describe a
business goal in natural language; a plan-and-execute Agent decomposes it into steps
and orchestrates three extension surfaces — `.fyp` plugins, `.fys` skills, and
in-process AI tools — to carry it out. It runs as a headless Spring Boot backend, a
React 19 + TypeScript UI, and an optional Electron desktop shell.

::: info 4.0.0-alpha
Infinia 4.0.0 is an **unsigned Alpha**. See the [Quick Start](/en/quickstart) to build
and run from source, or the [Features](/en/features) page for what the Agent can orchestrate today.
