# AI Chat

AI Chat is the conversational surface in Infinia. Pick a backend, send a prompt, and read the reply token-by-token as a server-sent events (SSE) stream. While the model is working it can stream its own thinking and call plugin tools inline; finished conversations are persisted so you can reopen them later.

## Backends

Chat runs against four backends, selected in [Configuration](/en/guide/configuration) under AI config:

| Mode | Backend | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `local` | Ollama | Talks to an **external `ollama serve`** process over its local HTTP API. The backend does not load a GGUF in-process. |
| `openai` | OpenAI | Standard OpenAI API. |
| `anthropic` | Anthropic | Anthropic Messages API. |
| `deepseek` | DeepSeek | DeepSeek is **OpenAI-compatible** — driven through the OpenAI-style adapter. |

The active mode is whatever `PUT /api/ai/config` last persisted; it is hot-swapped at runtime via `BackendReactivator.reactivate()` so a mode switch takes effect without a restart.

## Context management

The complete transcript remains stored and visible, but the model-facing copy is automatically
compacted before a long turn exceeds the provider window. FengYu estimates tokens from UTF-8 bytes;
at 60% of the configured context window it summarizes the oldest complete rounds into a marked
assistant context note, preserves system messages, and keeps the latest eight rounds verbatim. A
summary failure is non-fatal and falls back to the original history.

Set **Context Window** in AI Configuration to the actual window supported by the selected model.
The default is 32,768 tokens; `0` disables automatic compaction. Tool results are governed
separately: a result larger than 64 KiB keeps its head and tail in model context so one tool cannot
consume the remaining window, while the live SSE activity still receives the complete result.

## Request flow

A chat turn is a two-step request: start the run, then open the SSE stream.

```text
POST /api/ai/chat
  Content-Type: application/json
  X-FengYu-Token: <token>
  { "messages": [ { "role": "user", "content": "Summarize this workbook" } ],
    "permissionMode": "ask-for-approval",
    "workflowId": "<optional: bind this turn to a flow — see AI Agent → Visual flows>" }

  ◄── 200 { "streamId": "<uuid>", "activeFileRefs": [...] }

GET /api/ai/stream?streamId=<uuid>
  X-FengYu-Token: <token>
  Accept: text/event-stream

  ◄── SSE stream (see below)
```

The first frame on the stream is a `:connected` comment heartbeat — it confirms the stream is open before any events arrive.

### Files and directories

Every conversation owns its attachments and resources — they never leak across chats. Add a file or a folder from the **+** menu and it joins the conversation draft as a read-only attachment (folders include their subdirectories): one chip per selection, no plugin ids, no approval card, and **nothing is granted or copied until you actually send**. When you send, the host takes its own copy of each attachment (the content as of that moment — later edits to the original are not picked up until you refresh) and the turn's file access is derived from those copies, then released when the turn ends. Removing a chip stops future turns from using it, while a running turn drains safely; a draft attachment you never sent is removed locally with zero server-side residue. Re-sending the same path replaces its revision; same-named files from different folders stay independent, and a late response always lands in the conversation that started it, even if you switched away. Sending is idempotent per attempt — a network retry never duplicates your message, copies, or the model call.

The **Set output folder** entry (desktop shells) registers where Infinia saves generated results. This authorizes the *host* to save there — it never widens what plugin workers can write. With an output folder set, generated files save directly and the result card offers **Open** and **Show in Finder**/**Show in folder**; without one, the result is kept as *ready to save* and you pick a location on the card. A failed save never deletes the generated file — retry is always available. Unsaved results are kept for 7 days and restored (without their folder authorization) after a restart; deleting the conversation reclaims them.

You can still type an existing absolute path in the latest user message. Typed paths become read-only resources of the same conversation-scoped registry — the model can never mint grants by mentioning a path. Flow run panels keep their own run-owned grants and are unaffected.

### Coding workspace

The **Attach coding workspace** entry (also in the **+** menu; desktop uses the native folder picker, the browser form takes a typed absolute path) turns the conversation into a coding session: while a workspace is attached, the model gains `read_file`, `write_file`, `edit_file`, `grep`, and `glob` tools restricted to that folder, and a workspace chip shows (and can change or detach) the active root.

The tools follow terminal coding-agent practice:

- **Every path is jailed to the root.** Relative paths resolve against it; absolute paths are accepted only when they land inside it; symbolic links are collapsed before the containment check, so a link planted in the tree can never redirect a read or write outside the workspace.
- **Writes go through the permission pipeline.** `write_file`/`edit_file` declare the `write` effect: in *ask-for-approval* mode every write shows an approval card, `Effect(write)` permission rules apply, and *full access* still cannot bypass the dangerous-path floor.
- **Read before edit.** Editing or overwriting an existing file requires that the model read it in this conversation, and the edit is rejected if the file changed on disk since that read. `read_file` returns line-numbered text; `edit_file` accepts an old string copied straight from that output (its matcher tolerates cosmetic drift such as smart quotes or the line-number prefix) and refuses ambiguous or stale edits.
- **Search stays bounded.** `grep`/`glob` cap their results and skip build, VCS, and dependency directories (`.git`, `node_modules`, `target`, …), so a question never scans half the disk.
- **Changes are shown as diffs.** Every `write_file`/`edit_file` result carries a unified diff, rendered as an expandable colored block under the tool's activity row.

Detaching the workspace (the chip's ✕) removes the coding tools from the conversation's next turn. Attach a different folder at any time from the chip's edit button.

::: warning
The SSE endpoint is `GET /api/ai/stream?streamId=...`. There is **no** `?token=` query parameter. Authenticate the stream request with the `X-FengYu-Token` header, the same as every other endpoint.

## SSE events

Every event is an SSE frame named after its type. See [SSE Events](/en/reference/sse-events) for the full taxonomy.

| Event | Data | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `token` | `{text}` | A chunk of the assistant's reply. Concatenate to rebuild the message. |
| `thinking` | `{text}` | A chunk of the model's chain-of-thought. |
| `tool` | `call`: `{phase:"call", name, arguments}` | The model decided to call a tool (plugin or built-in). |
| `tool` | `result`: `{phase:"result", id, success, output}` | The tool returned. `success:false` carries an error in `output`. |
| `done` | `{text, tokens, tps}` | The turn is complete. `text` is the full reply; `tps` is tokens/sec. |
| `error` | `{message}` | The run failed. The stream ends after this frame. |

A representative stream:

```text
: connected

event: token
data: {"text":"Let me check "}

event: tool
data: {"phase":"call","name":"excel_analyze","arguments":"{\"filePath\":...}"}

event: tool
data: {"phase":"result","id":"...","success":true,"output":"..."}

event: token
data: {"text":"the workbook has 3 sheets."}

event: done
data: {"text":"Let me check the workbook has 3 sheets.","tokens":42,"tps":18.6}
```

### Rendering

- **Thinking** renders as collapsed cards — one card per thinking span, expandable on click so it stays out of the way unless you want it.
- **Tool calls** render as compact activity rows such as `Read FengYu Plugin Dev skill` and update in place as the call runs or completes.
- **Approvals** render inside the composer, directly above the text area. The transcript keeps the compact activity row instead of inserting a large approval card between messages.

### Permission modes

The composer offers three per-turn profiles:

| Mode | Behaviour |
| --- | --- |
| **Ask for approval** | Reads run directly; command execution, document/file changes, and external actions ask before they run. |
| **Approve for me** | Safe sandboxed commands and declared reads/writes run automatically; commands detected as risky and external/network actions still ask. |
| **Full access** | Runs without tool approval and executes commands without the native file/network sandbox. Sensitive inherited environment variables are still removed. |

Plugin tools declare their effect in the manifest, so the same gate covers both built-in and out-of-process plugin actions. A missing effect is handled conservatively as an external action.

### Command results

`execute_command` returns stdout and stderr separately, including a truncation flag for each stream.
When a stream exceeds its configured capture limit, FengYu preserves both the beginning and the end
with an omitted-character marker, so trailing compiler or shell errors remain available. The legacy
combined `output` and `truncated` fields remain present for compatible consumers.

### Web discovery and visual browser results

Two host-embedded read tools keep ordinary research out of the stateful browser: `web_search`
returns compact public-web result titles/URLs, and `web_fetch` retrieves bounded readable text.
Both reject local/private-network targets and run as `read` effects. Use the desktop-only
`browser_*` tools when the task needs navigation, page state, login context, or interaction.

`browser_screenshot` sends the actual PNG to Spring AI as an `image/png` media part after its tool
response, so a vision-capable model can inspect the pixels. The same result also contains a DOM
snapshot and accessibility tree for text-only models. Images are preserved in the in-memory tool
history for follow-up model rounds; conversation persistence remains text-only. Gateways that
only accept string `content` (no multimodal arrays) are handled automatically: the round is
retried once without the image and the endpoint stays text-only from then on — screenshots keep
arriving in the chat UI.

For interaction-heavy pages, the desktop browser surface also exposes history navigation,
ref-targeted hover and bounded wheel scrolling, verified native option selection, and page-level
keyboard input. A successful back/forward/reload invalidates cached refs, so the model must inspect
the new page state before acting again.

### Computer use (screen control)

Desktop builds additionally expose the `computer_*` family — ChatGPT-desktop-style computer use
driven by `java.awt.Robot` inside the backend JVM: `computer_screenshot` captures the real screen
(the PNG reaches a vision model exactly like `browser_screenshot`), `computer_displays` /
`computer_apps` / `computer_cursor_position` observe the environment, and `computer_click` /
`computer_double_click` / `computer_mouse_move` / `computer_drag` / `computer_scroll` /
`computer_type` / `computer_key` inject real input; `computer_key_sequence` runs up to 50 ordered
keys/shortcuts in one approved call for keyboard navigation. `computer_app_launch` and
`computer_app_activate` open or focus applications (`open -a`, PowerShell `Start-Process`/
`AppActivate`, `gtk-launch`/`wmctrl`). All coordinates are logical screen points; the screenshot
envelope reports the Hi-DPI `scale` so the model converts image pixels before clicking.

Every input-injecting call is an `external` effect and passes the per-turn approval gate; only
observing tools (`computer_screenshot`, `computer_displays`, `computer_apps`,
`computer_cursor_position`, `computer_wait`) classify as `read`. The family can be hidden entirely
with the **Settings → Runtime & security → Computer use** switch (`computerUseEnabled`, default on).
The same implementation runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux: **Windows needs no extra permissions**
(app listing/launch/activation use PowerShell; UAC secure-desktop and elevated-app windows stay
protected by the OS), while **macOS needs Screen Recording** (capture) **and Accessibility** (input)
permissions — without them captures show wallpaper only and input is dropped silently by the OS.
Captures are mirrored to `.fengyu/computer-screenshots/`. When no display is reachable every call
degrades to a `"computer use unavailable"` envelope instead of throwing.

## Conversations

Conversations are stored on the backend. All endpoints require the `X-FengYu-Token` header.

| Method + path | Body / query | Returns |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /api/ai/conversations` | — | Conversation summaries, **newest first**. |
| `GET /api/ai/conversations/{id}` | — | A single conversation (title + messages). |
| `POST /api/ai/conversations` | `{title, messages}` | The created conversation with its `id`. |
| `PUT /api/ai/conversations/{id}` | `{title, messages}` | Replaces both title and messages wholesale. |
| `DELETE /api/ai/conversations/{id}` | — | Removes the conversation. |

`PUT` is a full replace — send the complete `messages` array you want stored, not a delta.
