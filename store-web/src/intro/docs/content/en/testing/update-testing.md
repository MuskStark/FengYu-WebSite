# Application Update — Manual Test Checklist

End-to-end verification of the "detect update → user consents → self-download/install/restart"
flow across all three deployment modes. Each section is self-contained: run it on the target
platform with the listed prerequisites.

> The unit tests (`UpdateCheckServiceTest`, `portable-updater.test.ts`, `auto-updater.test.ts`)
> cover version comparison and detection logic. This checklist verifies the **real** download →
> verify → swap → relaunch pipeline, which must be exercised against a real GitHub release or an
> FY-Proxy intranet repository on the target OS.

---

## Shared prerequisites (all modes)

1. **Two releases must exist on GitHub** so "old" can detect "new":
   - An **older** tagged release you will install/run (e.g. `v4.0.0-beta.1`).
   - A **newer** tagged release available on the Releases page (e.g. `v4.0.0-beta.4`).
   - The newer release MUST have been built by `fengyu-release.yml` AFTER the changes in this
     feature landed (so `latest*.yml`, `*.blockmap`, and `checksums.txt` are published — required
     by electron-updater and the portable self-updater).
2. Confirm the newer release's assets include the ones your mode needs (see below).
3. Have the older build installed/extracted and running before you trigger the check.

### How to confirm the newer release has the required feed files

Open `https://github.com/MuskStark/FengYu/releases/tag/v<NEW_VERSION>` and confirm these assets
exist (if any is missing, the CI change did not take effect and auto-update cannot work):

| Asset | Required by |
|---|---|
| `latest.yml` (Windows) / `latest-mac.yml` (macOS) | electron-updater (NSIS install + macOS) |
| `*.blockmap` | electron-updater differential download |
| `Infinia-<ver>-win32-x64-portable.zip` | Windows portable self-update |
| `Infinia.jar` + `checksums.txt` | Portable Web (java -jar) self-update |

---

## Intranet / offline store channel (the store replaces FY-Proxy)

Set **Settings → Update channel → Upgrade channel URL** to the Infinia Store origin, for example
`http://10.0.0.5:8080` (the separately deployed store platform — it replaces the old FY-Proxy
distribution center, and the same value also routes plugin installs and cloud-account sign-in),
and turn on **"Allow private network (self-hosted store)"** on the same page — a custom channel
(including a `localhost` debug store) is only active while that toggle is on; with it off the
address stays dormant and the store and updates fall back to the official store and GitHub.
The value is persisted and loaded before the desktop window opens, so both the startup probe and
**About → Check for updates** avoid GitHub.

The store channel currently serves these asset classes:

| Platform/package | Required asset | Discovery endpoint (relative to the store base) |
|---|---|---|
| Windows portable x64 | STABLE-channel APP release with a `Infinia-<version>-win32-x64-portable.zip` artifact | `/api/v1/compat/fengyu/fengyu-releases/api/releases/latest?channel=windows-portable` |
| Debian/Ubuntu lite x64 | legacy FY-Proxy only, until the store ships an electron-updater feed | `/fengyu-updates/deb/latest-linux.yml` (FY-Proxy contract) |

Publish app releases through the store's publisher flow (an APP listing with versioned releases
and artifacts) instead of FY-Proxy's file upload page. For portable ZIP, the release response
carries a mandatory SHA-256 digest that Infinia verifies before extraction; the deb feed uses
electron-updater's SHA-512 verification. The manual download page becomes the store's web app
(`/web`). Confirm automatic discovery after launch, then use **About → Recheck** to confirm
manual discovery. NSIS, AppImage, macOS, JRE, and portable Web/JAR updates are deliberately
unsupported on the store channel.

---

## Mode 1: Windows NSIS install (`*-setup.exe`)

**Platform:** Windows 10/11 · **Update mechanism:** electron-updater

> Public GitHub channel only; FY-Proxy rejects NSIS assets.

### Setup
1. Download and install the **older** `*-win-x64-setup.exe`.
2. Launch Infinia from the Start menu / desktop shortcut.

### Steps
1. Open **About** (sidebar). The "Update" row should show
   `Version <NEW_VERSION> is available` after a few seconds (the StatusBar badge also appears).
2. Click **Update now**. A confirmation popover appears warning the build is unsigned.
3. Click **Continue**.
4. A download progress indicator fills (the `update:progress` IPC events flow).
5. On completion the app **quits and the NSIS installer runs silently**, then Infinia relaunches.
   - Windows SmartScreen MAY warn (unsigned build) — click "More info" → "Run anyway". This is
     expected for unsigned builds.
6. After relaunch, open **About** again — the version should now read `<NEW_VERSION>`, and the
   "Update" row should say "Up to date".

### Pass criteria
- [ ] Update detected on the older build
- [ ] Download progress visible
- [ ] App quits, installer runs, app relaunches
- [ ] New version confirmed in About after relaunch
- [ ] StatusBar badge gone after update

### Common failures
| Symptom | Likely cause |
|---|---|
| "Update check failed" in About | `latest.yml` not published on the release (CI glob missing) |
| Download never starts | `signedRelease` gating — the consent IPC path should bypass it; check `update:download-install` is reached (DevTools → Network/Console) |
| App quits but doesn't relaunch | NSIS `--updated` flow failed; check the installer log in `%TEMP%` |

## Mode 2: Windows portable zip (`*-portable.zip`)

**Platform:** Windows 10 1803+ · **Update mechanism:** custom pipeline (`portable-updater.ts`)

> electron-updater CANNOT update a portable zip — this mode uses a custom download → tar extract
> → robocopy replace → relaunch pipeline. This is the mode most likely to surface file-lock or
> single-instance issues, so test it carefully.

### Setup
1. Download and extract the **older** `*-win-x64-portable.zip` to a folder, e.g.
   `C:\Users\<you>\Infinia\`.
2. Run `C:\Users\<you>\Infinia\Infinia.exe`.

### Steps
1. Open **About** → the "Update" row detects `<NEW_VERSION>` (via the GitHub API or the configured
   FY-Proxy `windows-portable` release endpoint, not `latest.yml`).
2. Click **Update now** → **Continue** (unsigned warning).
3. Download progress fills (the portable zip is large; watch the percent).
4. The app **quits**. A detached `.bat` (in `%TEMP%`) takes over:
   - Waits for the old `Infinia.exe` PID + backend JVM tree to exit (tasklist polling).
   - Sweeps any process still running from the install folder (a leaked plugin worker keeps the
     bundled `resources\jre` image files locked).
   - `robocopy`s the extracted new tree over the install folder, retrying once if destination
     files were still locked.
   - Restarts `Infinia.exe`.
5. Infinia relaunches automatically.

### Pass criteria
- [ ] Portable detection worked (About shows an update, NOT a silent failure)
- [ ] Download progress visible
- [ ] Old process fully exits before file replacement (no "file in use" error)
- [ ] `Infinia.exe` + `resources\binaries\FengYu.jar` + `resources\app.asar` all replaced
- [ ] App relaunches with the new version (About shows `<NEW_VERSION>`)
- [ ] No second-instance error on relaunch (single-instance lock released cleanly)

### How to inspect the update if it fails
- The detached bat log: `%TEMP%\fengyu-portable-update-<pid>.log`
- The bat itself (before self-delete): `%TEMP%\fengyu-portable-update-<pid>.bat`
- Staging dir: `%TEMP%\fengyu-portable-update-*\` (extracted new tree)
- Run from a cmd window to see console output: `Infinia.exe` logs to
  `<runtime>\.fengyu\logs\`.

### Common failures
| Symptom | Likely cause |
|---|---|
| `tar extraction failed` | Windows older than 10 1803 (no bsdtar); or the zip asset name doesn't contain `-portable.zip` |
| robocopy reports "file in use" | A process was still running from the install folder (a leaked plugin worker locks the bundled JRE). The replace bat sweeps app-tree processes before copying and retries robocopy once; if it still fails, read the sweep output and robocopy exit code in `.fengyu/logs/update.log` |
| App relaunches but immediately exits | Single-instance lock not released (old process still alive); or the new exe path differs |
| About never shows an update | `isWindowsPortable()` returned false — confirm `resources\app-update.yml` is ABSENT in the portable extract |

---

## Mode 3: Portable Web (`java -jar`, run.sh / run.bat)

**Platform:** any (macOS/Linux/Windows) · **Update mechanism:** backend `SelfUpdateService`
(JAR download → SHA256 verify → detached restart script → JVM exit → swap → relaunch)

> This is the only mode testable end-to-end on macOS/Linux. It swaps only the JAR (the launcher
> scripts and plugins stay put). This mode is available only through GitHub; FY-Proxy rejects JAR
> assets.

### Setup
1. Download and extract the **older** `Infinia-<OLD>-web.zip` (or `.tar.gz`).
2. Launch it:
   - macOS/Linux: `./run.sh`
   - Windows: `run.bat`
3. Note the generated token printed to stderr (`Generated per-launch token ...: zf-...`).
4. Open the UI in a browser at the printed URL (or use curl with the token).

### Steps
1. Open **About** → "Update" row shows `<NEW_VERSION>` is available.
   - The release MUST have an `Infinia.jar` asset AND a `checksums.txt` asset (both published by
     the release workflow). Without `checksums.txt`, the SHA256 verification step fails.
2. Click **Update now** → **Continue**.
3. The backend:
   - Downloads `Infinia.jar` from the release to a staging file.
   - Downloads `checksums.txt`, parses the `Infinia.jar` line, verifies SHA256.
   - Generates `self-update.sh` (POSIX) or `self-update.bat` (Windows) into
     `<runtime>\runtime-files\`.
   - Spawns the script detached, then exits the JVM (`System.exit` after a 1s flush delay).
4. The detached script:
   - Waits for the old JVM PID to exit (`tail --pid=` on POSIX / `tasklist` on Windows).
   - Backs up the old JAR to `Infinia.jar.bak`.
   - Moves the downloaded JAR into place.
   - Re-launches `java -jar Infinia.jar <original args>`.
5. The new backend comes up; the browser reconnects (StatusBar dot returns to green).

### Pass criteria
- [ ] Update detected (About shows `<NEW_VERSION>`)
- [ ] Download + SHA256 verification succeed (check the backend log for
      `[self-update] checksum verified`)
- [ ] Old JVM exits cleanly (backend log shows context close + shutdown hooks)
- [ ] JAR replaced: `Infinia.jar` is the new version, `Infinia.jar.bak` is the old
- [ ] New JVM restarts with the same port/token (UI reconnects without manual action)
- [ ] About now shows `<NEW_VERSION>` and "Up to date"

### How to inspect the update if it fails
- Backend log: `<extract>\data\logs\` (the `-Dfengyu.runtime.dir=$ROOT/data` location).
- Restart script: `<extract>\data\runtime-files\self-update.sh` (or `.bat`).
- Restart script log: `<extract>\data\runtime-files\self-update-*.log`.
- Staging download: `<extract>\data\runtime-files\update-staging-*.jar`.

### Common failures
| Symptom | Likely cause |
|---|---|
| `SHA-256 mismatch for Infinia.jar` | `checksums.txt` on the release is stale or doesn't match the published JAR |
| `checksums.txt has no entry for Infinia.jar` | The release was built before `checksums.txt` was added to the CI collect step |
| Old JAR not replaced (still old version after restart) | Detached script wasn't truly detached (process died with the JVM); or `java.class.path` didn't resolve to the JAR path |
| JVM exits but nothing restarts | Script's relaunch command is wrong — inspect `self-update.sh`, check the `exec java ...` line has the right `-D` flags and `--token` |
| Restarts but on a different port | The relaunch didn't carry `--port=<n>` through; `sun.java.command` parsing in `SelfUpdateService.buildRelaunchCommand` missed it |

## Mode 4: macOS desktop (`*-mac-arm64.dmg`)

**Platform:** macOS (Apple Silicon) · **Update mechanism:** manual download (unsigned Gatekeeper fallback)

> macOS unsigned builds CANNOT auto-relaunch after a `quitAndInstall` (Gatekeeper blocks the
> replaced bundle). The app degrades to "download + open releases page". This is intentional
> until code-signing + notarization lands. FY-Proxy intranet mode does not support macOS.

### Setup
1. Download and install the **older** `*-mac-arm64.dmg` (drag Infinia to Applications).
2. On first launch, right-click → Open (to bypass Gatekeeper for the unsigned old build).
3. Run Infinia.

### Steps
1. Open **About** → "Update" row detects `<NEW_VERSION>`.
   - Note: the About page detects macOS and shows an **"Open page"** button instead of
     "Update now" (because the shell's `update:download-install` IPC returns `{action:'manual'}`
     on darwin).
2. Click **Open page** → browser opens the GitHub releases page.
3. Download the **newer** `*-mac-arm64.dmg` manually.
4. Replace the old Infinia.app in /Applications (drag the new one in, agree to replace).
5. Right-click → Open the new Infinia (Gatekeeper warning again — unsigned).

### Pass criteria
- [ ] Update detected
- [ ] "Open page" button shown (NOT "Update now" — confirms the darwin branch)
- [ ] Releases page opens to the right URL
- [ ] After manual replacement, new version confirmed in About

### Future: when code-signing lands
Re-run Mode 4 after a signed+notarized build: the darwin branch in `ipc/update.ts` should be
changed to call `downloadUpdate()` + `quitAndInstall()` (same as Windows NSIS), and the About
button should switch to "Update now". At that point the full auto flow applies.

---

## Cross-mode sanity checks (quick, after any successful update)

Regardless of mode, after a successful update verify the app is fully functional, not just
"new version number":

- [ ] **Plugins still load**: open Tools — the 4 official plugins appear (markdown/excel/
      email/offlinepython; browser automation is a host-embedded capability, not a plugin).
      The updated JAR/asar must have shipped matching plugin packages.
- [ ] **AI chat works**: send a message in Chat — a response streams back.
- [ ] **Database intact**: open Settings — the DB config persisted across the restart (the
      `data/` runtime dir was NOT wiped by the update).
- [ ] **Re-check returns "up to date"**: About → "Recheck" → now says "Up to date" (the new
      build's version equals the latest release tag).
